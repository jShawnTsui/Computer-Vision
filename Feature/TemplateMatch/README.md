[Back to Computer Vision Projects List][1]
It manually selects a sample of Waldo, and get the maximum frequency in y-axis. 
And makes a Gabor filter based on the frequency. Then convolute the preprocessed 
image with that filter, to find the local maxima above a threshold in the response, 
where have great chances to be the Waldoâ€™s.
